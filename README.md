## work in progress

### money modes
###### the purpose of this app is to give users a chance to look at their bank statements and other banking information in a different modality. Now one may ask, what is a different modalitiy. An example is taken written numbers, eg a bank statement, and turning them into 3d objects that represent their meaning (ratio to one another). 

###### users will be able to upload their information, customize a modality to view or even listen their data. after this the user will be able to edit and delete all information.
